## Extending the Comparison of Classification Models for Rare Civil War Onsets

In similar fashion as [Muchlinski et al., 2016](http://davidsiroky.faculty.asu.edu/predictcivilwar.pdf), this blog aims to add discussion and facilitate usage of the insofar discarded predictive statistical methods in political science, to aid in accurately predicting significant events such as civil wars. Comparisons are made via Roc-Auc Curves to compare the performance of K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Boosted Decision Trees, and Neural Networks. Particular attention is afforded to the performance of this methods when coupled with, but also without feature selection methods. The three feature selection methods of no feature selection, offline selection with Chi and Anova, and online selection with Recursive Feature Elimination are applied, in order to best illustrate which models can, and which cannot leverage the data to feature select by themselves. Lastly, certain models withstand the benefit of interpretability in how they provide their predictions, such as the Random Forest and the Boosted Decision Tree. These are illustrated and contrasted to the uninterpretable models.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/KamranSattary/ADA_P4_Blog/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
